# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  This website is about anything I find interestingâ€”mostly a 
  place for me to document things so I can remember them. 
  Maybe others will find some useful info as I solve my 
  own problems. I'm interested in DevOps, SRE, coding, 
  keyboards, and electronics (not that I'm great at it, haha)..
baseurl: / # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: https://mr-76.github.io/Mr-76/ # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
