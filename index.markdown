Welcome to  my blog.

This site is where I document the problems I’ve faced and how I solved them. I focus on DevOps, infrastructure, firewalls, electronics, and coding, but I also cover other technical areas when needed.

I don’t just share solutions—I explain what I did, why I did it, and what worked (or didn’t). Whether it's troubleshooting network issues, setting up infrastructure, automating tasks, or experimenting with hardware, this is my space to keep track of what I’ve learned.

It’s mainly for my own reference, but if it helps someone else along the way, even better!
